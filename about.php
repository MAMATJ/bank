<p>Online Bank is one of the oldest private
Commercial Banks operating in Bangladesh. It is
a top bank among the oldest five Commercial
Banks in the country which started their
operations in 1983. The Bank started its journey
on 27th March 1983 through opening its first
branch at B. B. Avenue Branch in the capital,
Dhaka city. It was the visionary entrepreneurship
of around 13 local businessmen who braved the
immense uncertainties and risks with courage
and zeal that made the establishment & forward
march of the bank possible. Those sponsor
directors commenced the journey with only Taka
3.4 crore worth of Capital, which now is a
respectable Taka 2311.78 crore as capital &
reserve.
Online Bank is among the very few local banks
which do not follow the traditional, decentralized,
geographically managed, branch based business
or profit model. Instead the bank manages its
business and operation vertically from the head
office through 5 distinct Units namely
</br>
I. Business Unit</br>
II. Branch Banking</br>
III. Risk Unit</br>
IV. Operations Unit</br>
V. Support</br>
Under a real-time online banking platform, these
5 distinct Units are supported at the back by a
robust service delivery or operations setup and
also a smart IT Backbone. Such centralized
business segment based business & operating
model ensure specialized treatment and services
to the bank's different customer segments.
The bank currently has total 112 branches which
includes 99 online branches, 1 full-fledged
Islamic Banking branch, 1 SME service center
and 11 SME/Agri branches spread across the
length & breadth of the country. Besides these
traditional delivery points, the bank is also very
active in the alternative delivery area. It currently
has 256 ATMs of its own; and ATM sharing
arrangement with partner banks that has more
than 1150 ATMs in place; SMS Banking; Internet
Banking and so on. It already started its
Customer Call Center operation.</p><h2><a href="home.php"><font color="green">Back to Home</font></a></h2>
